## How to install and run the projects

### Prerequisites

You’ll need the following:

1. **An Auth0 account.** The app uses Auth0 to provide authenticate users, which means that you need an Auth0 account. You can <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" 
  data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" 
  data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)">
  sign up for a free account</a>, which lets you add login/logout to 10 applications, with support for 7,000 users and unlimited logins. This should suit your prototyping, development, and testing needs.
2. **An Android development setup:** 
	* Any computer running Linux, macOS, or Windows from 2013 or later with at least 8 GB RAM. When it comes to RAM, more is generally better.
	* [**Java SE Developer Kit (JDK), version 11 or later.**](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html) You can find out which version is on your computer by opening a command-line interface and entering `java --version`.
	* [**Android Studio,**](https://developer.android.com/studio) version 3.6 (February 2020) or later. I used the current stable version of Android Studio when writing this article: version 2021.2.1, also known as “Chipmunk”.
	* **At least one Android SDK (Software Development Kit) platform.** You can confirm that you have one (and install one if you don’t) in Android Studio. Open **Tools → SDK Manager**. You’ll see a list of Android SDK platforms. Make sure that the current SDK (**Android 11.0 (R)** at the time of writing) is checked; if it isn’t, check it, click the **Apply** button, and click the **OK** button in the confirmation dialog that appears. Wait for the SDK platform to install and click the **Finish** button when installation is complete.
	* **An Android device, real or virtual:**
		* **Using a real device:** Connect the device to your computer with a USB cable. Make sure that your device has Developer Options and USB debugging enabled.
		* **Using a virtual device:** Using Android Studio, you can build a virtual device (emulator) that runs on your computer. Here’s my recipe for a virtual device that simulates a current-model inexpensive Android phone:
			1. Open **Tools → AVD Manager** (AVD is short for “Android Virtual Device”). The **Your Virtual Devices** window will appear. Click the **Create Virtual Device...** button.
			2. The **Select Hardware** window will appear. In the **Phone** category, select **Pixel 3a** and click the **Next** button.
			3. The **System Image** window will appear, and you’ll see a list of Android versions. Select **R** (API 30, also known as Android 11.0). If you see a **Download** link beside R, click it, wait for the OS to download, then click the **Finish** button. Then click the **Next** button.
			4. The **Android Virtual Device (AVD)** window will appear. The **AVD Name** field should contain **Pixel 3a API 30**, the two rows below it should have the titles **Pixel 3a** (a reasonable “representative” phone, released 3 years ago at the time of writing) and **R**, and in the **Startup orientation** section, **Portrait** should be selected. Click the **Finish** button.
			5. You will be back at the **Your Virtual Devices** window. The list will now contain **Pixel 3a API 30**, and that device will be available to you when you run the app.
      
      ### Running the complete project

The complete project is the result of downloading the start project and following the article’s instructions. It is provided for reference.

To use the complete project, download it, then connect it to Auth0 by doing the following:

* **Register the app in the Auth0 Dashboard:**
	* Log into the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/), select **Applications → Applications** from the left side menu, then click the **Create Application** button.
	* Enter a name for the app in the **Name** field and choose the **Native** application type.
	* Select the **Settings** tab and copy the **Domain** and **Client ID** values.
	* Scroll down the **Settings** page and paste `app://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/android/com.auth0.Android-Login/callback` into the  **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Login URLs** fields, replacing `{YOUR_DOMAIN}` with the value you copied from the **Domain** field.
	* Scroll to the bottom of the **Settings** page and click the **Save Changes** button.
* **Configure the app to connect to Auth0:**
	* 	Open the `auth0.xml` string resource file in the app project.
	* Change the contents of the `<string name="com_auth0_scheme">` tag from `TODO: Enter the scheme for your app’s callback and logout URLs here.` to `app`. 
	* Change the contents of the `<string name="com_auth0_domain">` tag from `TODO: Enter your tenant’s domain name here.` to the **Domain** value you copied from the Auth0 dashboard.
	* Change the contents of the `<string name="com_auth0_client_id">` tag from `TODO: Enter your tenant’s domain name here.` to the **Client ID** value you copied from the Auth0 dashboard.
* Run the app!
